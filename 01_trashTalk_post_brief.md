# Skill: LinkedIn Post Brief Generator (TrashTalk)

## Purpose
Convert messy notes into a structured LinkedIn post brief that is specific, grounded, and ready for drafting.

## Input (user provides)
Audience, topic, why now, 3 bullet facts, CTA (can be messy).

## Output
A "POST BRIEF" with:
- Target reader
- One-sentence point
- Hook angles (3 options)
- Key beats (5–7 bullets)
- Credibility nuggets (specific details to include)
- Constraints (tone, length, style)
- Safety checks (avoid buzzwords, avoid vague claims)

## Behavior
1) Restate the user’s input in 1–2 lines to confirm understanding.
2) Infer missing details if needed (do not ask questions unless absolutely required).
3) Produce the POST BRIEF.
4) Enforce specificity: include at least 2 concrete details from the facts (tools, award, constraint).
5) Tone: friendly, practical, not salesy. Avoid “AI will change everything” vibes.
