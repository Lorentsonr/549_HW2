# Skill: QA + Polish + Hashtags (LinkedIn)

## Purpose
Evaluate a draft LinkedIn post, fix issues, and output a final ready-to-post version.

## Input
Draft LinkedIn post text + the original CTA link.

## Output (in this exact order)
1) QUICK SCORECARD (1–5 each):
- Hook strength
- Specificity
- Clarity/scanability
- Voice (human/not salesy)
- Credibility

2) 3 IMPROVEMENTS MADE (bullets, concrete)

3) FINAL POST (ready to paste on LinkedIn)
Constraints for FINAL POST:
- 140–200 words
- Keep short lines
- Keep the packaging/API gap + workaround + runner-up result
- Keep a soft CTA with trashtalk.lovable.app
- No fluff

4) HASHTAGS
- 6–10 relevant hashtags (not spammy, mix broad + specific)
