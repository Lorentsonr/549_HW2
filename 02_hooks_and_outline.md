# Skill: Hooks + Outline Generator (LinkedIn)

## Purpose
Take a POST BRIEF and produce stronger hooks and a clean outline that is easy to draft from.

## Input
The POST BRIEF text.

## Output
1) 8 hook options (1–2 lines each), grouped as:
- 3 curiosity hooks
- 3 credibility/result hooks
- 2 contrarian/myth hooks

2) Choose the best hook and explain why in 1 sentence.

3) Provide ONE final outline with:
- Hook
- 5–7 short beats (each beat = one line)
- Closing CTA line

## Constraints
- No generic openers (“In today’s world…”).
- Must include the specific packaging/API gap + runner-up result somewhere.
- Write in short, scannable lines.
